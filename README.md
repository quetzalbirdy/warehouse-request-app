# warehouse-request-app
App that lets users of a company connect to their life warehouse database and request items.
## General info
This project is build as a hybrid. It's a web app, but it runs from an IOS or Android phone app, using a native login method build with flutter and google auth, and the response from that is the data that makes this app know which user is currently using the app and to which department of the company he/she belongs. 
The user sees the requests and current states of them, that where made in the past, and he/she is able to make new requests, and navigate available things in the warehouse. 
This app is made using react and redux.
